# ReadmeSorter
What do you do when you have a very large readme(or any other markdown file) with several headings and you need to keep them sorted in lexicographic order to make them look clean?<br>
You don't do anything. You simply use this package to solve your problem.

ReadmeSorter is a simple tool that will help you to sort your markdowns in lexicographic order and make it look neat and clean. <br>
Currently it is not sorting subheadings of headings present in markdown files. Support for subheadings will be available later.<br>

The issues currently being faced can be found [here](https://github.com/m-e-r-l-i-n/ReadmeSorter/issues).<br>
Feel free to make a pr.

## Instructions for use-
 - Download the package
 - Run the [ReadmeSort](https://github.com/m-e-r-l-i-n/ReadmeSorter/blob/master/src/ReadmeSort.java) file using 
    ```
     javac ReadmeSort.java
     java ReadmeSort
    ```
 - It will prompt you to enter path of input file. Add the file path `...\input_file_name.md`
 - It will prompt you to enter path of output file. Add the file path `...\output_file_name.md` Kindly make sure output file exists.
 - The output file will have the modified version of the input file
 - You can use the input file too as output file, as the program first reads all the input and then prints output.
